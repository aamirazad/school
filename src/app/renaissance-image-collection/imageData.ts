    caption:
      "This dome was constructed by Filippo Brunelleschi, who was an architect and engineer in Italy. The reason why this dome is special is that it highlights a lot of new techniques and ideas from the Renaissance. One of these new techniques is Perspective. In order to make the dome look bigger, Brunelleschi made the other buildings around it small. The ability to make a dome during this time was also special because most people were not able to make a dome of that size without supports. He did this with techniques like alternating the bricks and using two domes, one inside and one outside. In addition, the Renaissance brought Roman techniques back and is shown here by the dome's very Roman design.",

    caption:
      "This painting is so well known for good reason. It shows many new Renaissance influences, such as its focus on humanism, realism, and perspective. It is humanistic because it is a painting of a person, showing all the qualities of a human. Furthermore, it shows religious aspects, which is what pre-humanistic art mostly looked like. It is very realistic, showing all the details in her face as well as in the background. Perspective is a new technique that sets Leonardo da Vinci apart. It can be seen in the background, which creates depth and makes her face pop out.",

      "This, now extremely well known, painting by Michelangelo is a fresco painting by Michelangelo that goes into part of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling. The painting represents a scene in the Book of Genesis where God gives life to Adam. Renaissance characteristics are very much present in its use of realism and perspective. Shading is used to give a sense of depth behind Adam. God's outstretched hand is almost, but not quite, touching Adam's hand to give him life, who would give life to the rest of mankind. Humanism is also shown in very interesting connection back from God to the human. Some believe the people behind God is a representation of the human brain's anatomy, a very accurate one in that. In addition the red cloth around god is similar to the human uterus, symbolizing how God created Adam. The painting is surrounded by hundreds of square meters of Biblical art pieces on the roof of the Sistine Chapel",

      "This is one of the most obvious use of color. During this time, there was no artificial dyes so all colors had to be made from natural sources. This means some colors were expensive and sometimes almost impossible to get. Jacopo Tintoretto uses these colors to represent life, showing St Mark to rescue a slave. The art piece has the feeling of a play, with all the action and the crowd watching",

      "The Gates of Paradise is not an example of art, but an example of the other places the immense amount of money going into artists went. In Florence during 1401, a competition was held to create the doors to the Baptistery of San Giovanni, with lots of money going to the winner. This is because rich families like the Medici, paid people like this to build sculptures and other things in Florence. That is why they could afford to put so much gold in the doors. These bronze doors are a great example of Renaissance sculpture. It shows the artists use of linear perspective, with the design on the door but also the tiles around it receding to make the door look bigger.",

Also, the posture, gesture, and expression showed his belief in the motions of the soul. The painting was commissioned by Ludovico Sforza with their family's initials on the painting. He tried to use a new technique using oil point on two layers on a dry paper base. But this caused the painting to deteriorate and flake within a few years",

Both were wealthy merchants who, due to Florence's social structure, like many other merchants, had lots of money to spend on art. The clothing shows wealth due to it's color and type. Like his other painting, all of the objects in the painting are painted with extreme detail, a characteristic of the Renaissance. Developed during the Renaissance, oil painting as seen in this painting allowed for more colors and better blending. Also, perspective is used by creating shadows from the light coming from the window.",
