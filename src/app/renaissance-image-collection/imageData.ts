      "This dome was constructed by Filippo Brunelleschi who was a architect and engineer in Italy. The reason why this dome is special is it highlights a lot of new techniques and ideas from the Renaissance. One of these new techniques is Perspective. In order to make the dome look bigger Brunelleschi, made the other buildings around it small. The ability to make a dome during this time was also special because most people were not able to make a dome of that size without supports. He did this with technique's like alternating the bricks and using two domes, one inside and one outside",

    caption:
      "This painting is so well known for good reason. It shows many new Renaissance influences such as it's focus on humanism, realism, and perspective. It is humanistic because it is a painting of a person, showing all the qualities of the human. It shows religious aspects which is what pre-humanistic art mostly looked like. It is very realistic showing all the detail's in her face as well as in the background. Perspective is a new technique that sets Leonardo da Vinci apart. It can be seen in the background which creates depth and makes her face pop out.",
